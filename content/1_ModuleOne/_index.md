# Introduction

## Learning Objectives <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->

This paragraph block should highlight the learning objectives of the workshop. A bulleted list works well for this purpose.

## Workshop Structure <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->
This paragraph block should be utilized to briefly explain the submodules that are going to be presented as well as the approximate total time for the workshop and individual submodules. <br>

For example:
<ul>
    <li> Prerequisites *(15 minutes)* </li>
    <li> Setting up an account for the solution *(15 minutes)* </li>
    <li> Module 1: Module 1 Title *(30 minutes)* </li>
    <li> Module 2: Module 2 Title *(30 minutes)* </li>
    <li> Module 3: Module 3 Title *(30 minutes)* </li>
</ul>

**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.

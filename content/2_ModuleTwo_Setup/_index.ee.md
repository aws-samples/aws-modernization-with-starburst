## Module Two Heading <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->

This paragraph block should be an introduction to the module about the method of setting up the workshop using EventEngine in AWS. Some typical examples of the steps in this process will explain logging out of any current AWS accounts, how to utilize the hashed URL, utilizing the Team Dashboard to log in to the AWS console, and ensure that the correct region is being selected.

**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.

# Event Engine <!-- MODIFY THIS HEADING -->
Welcome to the Event Engine Setup section! This means that you are attending an AWS Hosted Workshop! Event Engine is a tool created at AWS that provisions AWS accounts for workshop events like this! These accounts will automatically terminate 24 hours after the workshop begins so participants donâ€™t have to worry about leaving anything on. Each workshop participant will receive their own Event Engine AWS account.

Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:

    Creating a Cloud9 IDE Workspace
    Creating an IAM Role
    Attaching an IAM Role
    Configuring Cloud9 Workspace

The next page will show you how to gain access to your Event Engine dashboard!

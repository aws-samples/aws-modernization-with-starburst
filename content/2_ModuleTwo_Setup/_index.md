## Module Two Heading <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->

This paragraph block should be an introduction to the module about the self-guided method of setting up the workshop. Some typical examples of the steps in this process this will involve setting up an AWS account, signing up for the partner platform, requesting marketplace credits, and provisioning both IAM roles and necessary AWS services. As with everything else, submodules can be added by copying and pasting files. An example of content guidance can be found at the bottom of the page. Extra module files can be added as necessary.

**REMOVE:** With the exception of _index.md, the module folders and filenames should be changed to better reflect their content, i.e. 1_Planning as the folder and 11_HowToBegin as the first submodule. Changing the "weight" value of the header is ultimately what reflects the order the modules are presented.

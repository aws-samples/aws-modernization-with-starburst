# Clean-Up and Summary

## Clean-Up

There are no artifacts left over from this workshop that need to be cleaned up. Your Starburst Galaxy account will automatically shutdown any running clusters for you, and will be available whenever you choose to access the system in the future.

## Summary
In this workshop, we learned how to quickly set up a Starburst Galaxy account, set up a cluster, connect it to data in AWS and finally, how to run a set of interactive queries across two different data sources without needing to migrate or move the data beforehand.

The Starburst Galaxy account that you created is available to you to try an connect and query other datasets. To do this, please refer to the [Starburst Galaxy Documentation](https://docs.starburst.io/starburst-galaxy/get-started/index.html) and the tooltip guidance in the application.
